# Odin Recipes

This project is part of an assignment I'm taking in the Odin Project. It's my journey to reigniting my coding practice. Though these concepts are quite familiar to me, I thought it was prudent to start from scratch, rekindle my knowledge and see if there's anything new I might have never learned anyway. Anyway, have fun just like I am.
